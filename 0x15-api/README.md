## API

API stands for Application Programming Interface. Simply put, an API is a set of rules that enables one application to communicate with another. APIs can be used to allow different applications to share data and functionality. For example, if you use a weather app on your phone, it may be getting its data from an API provided by a weather service.

This project was further practice in working with API's. I collected data from the
[JSONPlaceholder REST API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/), and learned how
to export it to either CSV or JSON format.
